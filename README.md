# 100 Days of Code — C Programming

This repository documents my structured learning journey through the **100 Days of Code Challenge**, focused entirely on the C programming language.

The challenge involved consistent daily practice, solving **1–2 problems per day**, and learning key programming concepts step by step.

## 📌 Objectives

- Build strong fundamentals in C programming  
- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking  
- Practice consistency and coding discipline  
- Prepare for future learning in **DSA, system programming, and low-level development**

- Introduction to C & Basic Syntax  
- Data Types, Variables, Operators  
- Conditionals (`if`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Arrays (1D & 2D)  
- Strings & String Functions  
- Functions & Recursion  
- Pointers & Pointer Arithmetic  
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
